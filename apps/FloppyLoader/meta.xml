		<short_description>Loads homebrews from a floppy drive</short_description>
		<long_description>With this application you can load DOLs from a floppy drive!

Currently only the Amiga 1010 and 1011 are supported. You must connect it
via the sensor bar connector, then insert your floppy with a single file named
"boot.dol" and let FloppyLoader do the rest!
* Press "A" to start
* Press "HOME" to exit

NOTE: This application temporarily patches your IOS so HW_AHBPROT must be disabled
(it is if your Homebrew Channel runs on the IOS 58).

It also works on the Wii U.</long_description>
